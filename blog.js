            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>This article fits into the overarching and long-going discussion on the theoretical foundations of public management as a discipline, and its difference from traditional public administration.  The author tries to undo the complications relative to the definition of public management,  starting from its etimology and history. Other notable scholars such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/973030" target="_blank">H. Simon</a> and L. E. Lynn have expressed their views on this sensitive debate, that is critical to understand the pillars and future evolution of this field.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <p>Starting from a commonly shared definition of public management as \"the study and practice of design and operation of arrangements for the provision of public services and executive government\", the author analyzes public management by focusing on three dimensions: the word, the movement and the science.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>\"The Word\":</strong> when analyzing the evolution of terminology on the study of government functioning over the centuries, Hood does not dismiss the idea that \"fashion\" is setting the pace. The word \"administration\" was more popular during the 19th century, while in the second part of the 20th century the expression \"public management\" acquired more and more visibility, also thanks to the introduction of specific graduate school programs in the US. In the 2000's it was \"governance\" that acquired increasing popularity.  But is there a platonic essence of public management behind the different terms? Although he does not underplay the different focus of the study of government over time, he claims that argumentation plays a key role in the evolution of public management paradigms (see \"<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/009539979402500404\" target=\"_blank\">Key for locks in administrative argument</a>\", Hood and Jackson 1994 for a more precise account of this)</li>
                <li><strong>\"The Movement\":</strong> the author claims that the public management movement that emerged in the United States during the 1980s can be recognized as a distinct movement due to several defining characteristics: it stands in opposition to traditional public administration, promotes a specific worldview centered on managerial leadership and organizational efficiency, and employs a distinctive rhetorical style. It did not arise without opposition, especially from the supporters of a law-centered approach to government. </li>
                <li><strong>\"The Science\":</strong> the author argues that currently public management cannot be considered a science in the traditional sense of a \"body of knowledge founded on strict experimental methods and rigorous logical reasoning\". However, a growing group of scholars is pushing towards a more \"systematic analysis\" of the discipline, in three aspects: elaborating a better description of the phenomena it wants to study (for example the implementation of control systems in public organizations based on output and outcome vs input), collecting and analyzing comparative data (for example the comparison of administrative and bureaucratical reforms in different countries) and identifying  anomalies that challenge pre-existing theories. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Hood's view can be summarized by saying that public management as a discipline is strongly dependent on argumentation and persuasion. Although it aspires to be a science, its subject-matter (organizations and decision-making) will always generate opposing world-views.</p>
            <h3>Relevance for current times:</h3>
            <p>Undergraduate students interested in this field, when facing the decision to enroll in a graduate school might be confused when seeing program names such as \"Public Policy and Administration\", \"Public Management\" or \"Government\". Where is the difference? Why should I prioritize one or the other?</p>
            <p>Hood tries to explain us how argumentation has been central in the development of the discipline of public management, and how it will continue to play a key role in every situation when scientific principles cannot be purely applied. Students should be aware how different terms have evolved to signal different perspectives on the study of government, and how scholars might adhere to one or the other view. This does not mean that programs containing the word \"administration\" will apply exclusively concepts from the 19th century, but it is just a reminder that words matter, and their choice always has an underlying meaning.</p>

            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>Laurence E. Lynn is recognized as one of the leading scholars in public management and administration. I've chosen to highlight one of his articles early in this blog to offer an alternative perspective on the evolution of the field, after presenting C. Hood's views. While this  piece may not be among his most well-known works, I find it particularly insightful, especially in its treatment of historical aspects.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <p>L.E. Lynn argues that public management and public administration should be considered synonyms. By defining the field as "encompassing the organizational structures, managerial practices, and institutionalized values by which officials enact the will of sovereign authority, whether that authority is prince, parliament, or civil society", he says there should be no distinction between "management" and "administration" within the public sphere. There is however a clear difference between public and private management, due to the distinctive challenges arising from features of governmental institutions.</p>
            <p>He describes the evolution of public management as a field across several eras:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Origins in the Chinese empire during the second century B.C.</li>
                <li>Development of cameralism as a new idea in the German states during the 17th century</li>
                <li>Emergence of bureaucracy by the end of the 19th century in most of Europe (with the British exception and its unique paradigm based on limited government and popular sovereignty)</li>
                <li>Scientific orientation elaborated by American thought-leaders, and clear separation between politics and administration</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As the 20th century progressed into its second half, the debate grew increasingly polarized on which theory should be behind the core of public administration. In the 1970s, a pivotal shift occurred as prominent American universities advocated for a renewed role of public managers, emphasizing their importance in steering public administration effectively. This shift generated a significant change also in academic curricula, with a focus towards a "craft" type of education. Meanwhile, European scholars began to reconsider the prevailing legalistic framework, influenced both by American ideas and the economic crisis of the mid-1970s, which necessitated a greater focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness in government operations.</p>
            <p>Lynn describes a "globalization" of the field  following the 1990s, attributing this change to the emergence of a new framework: the New Public Management. Customer-orientation, managerialism and a focus on performance were the key characteristics of this new set of ideas, that quickly spread around the world, both within institutions and in academia.</p>
            <p>The author concludes the article by trying to extract the essence of public management, regardless of national differences. Across the centuries it is the "relationship between bureaucracy and democracy, between administrators and people, between managerial responsibility and popular sovereignty and the rule of law" that has driven the discipline's evolution, among academics and practitioners.</p>
            <h3>Relevance for current times:</h3>
            <p>In a world where political appeal changes at unforeseen speed, how is the field of public management evolving? After its moment of maximum popularity in the 1990's, New Public Management (the focus of the next post) suffered strong criticism. New paradigms such as "Governance" and "Digital governance", "Public value management" or "Agile public management" emerged more recently, each attracting considerable attention from scholars and professionals.</p>

            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>This highly cited article by C. Hood introduces and captures the essence of one of the most popular and defining doctrines of public policy and administration: the New Public Management. Despite harsh criticism and attempts to reverse the main changes brought by NPM in public organizations, it cannot be denied that NPM - inspired reforms are still essential elements of modern public entities.</p>
            <p>Post-NPM paradigms have all been characterized by a rejection of NPM values and ideas. However, I think it is beneficial to study and isolate its aspects that were effective, to build a more resilient future model (see <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14719037.2023.2281981" target="_blank">Funck and Karlsson, 2023</a> for a more complete discussion on this point).</p>
            <p>Hood's main argument is that NPM ideas can be radically transformative, but might not be fit "for all seasons", more specifically they might not be compatible with different administrative values. I am going to summarize the key insights from the article, focusing particularly on the description and analysis of the features of NPM.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <p>Hood's article can be divided into 3 parts: explanations of the rise of NPM, description of the defining doctrines of NPM and criticism.</p>
            <h4>1. Explanations for the rise of NPM:</h4>
            <p>NPM started to emerge during the late 70's in the UK. The author defines 4 administrative megatrends that seem to be linked to NPM:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Deceleration of government growth</li>
                <li>Privatization of public sector</li>
                <li>Automation in public services delivery through ICT</li>
                <li>International agenda in public administration</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Among the potential explanations for NPM success and rapid popularity, the author does not exclude political and social factors, such as the rise of the "New Right" in the UK, an increasingly richer and heterogeneous population, and the development of new technologies that reduced barriers between private and public sector. The strength of the movement was not only the novelty of its ideas but also the possibility it represented to go beyond the values of traditional public administration.</p>
            <h4>2. Defining doctrines of NPM:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Presence of managers at the top of public organizations, with clear accountability</li>
                <li>Setting targets and quantitative indicators of success</li>
                <li>Performance-based rewards and resource allocation, focusing more on results than processes</li>
                <li>Breaking down of departments into smaller organizational units and decentralization to promote clear management</li>
                <li>Externalization and contracting, promoting competition for provision of public services</li>
                <li>More flexibility in hiring and firing, with introduction of private sector style and culture</li>
                <li>Cutting costs, stressing efficiency in operations</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>This article, published by Oxford University Press, is a fundamental piece in pinpointing some critical definitions in the public sector strategy literature. The first author, J. Bryson, published a highly influential book in 1988 titled Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations, which constitutes the basis of this new article, co-authored with B. George, a rising scholar.</p>
            <p>This topic bridges theory and practice in public management; while managers frequently engage in strategy-making in their day-to-day jobs, academics have sought to theorize processes and models, highlight success factors, and explain the differences between corporate and public sector strategy.</p>
            <p>The main contribution of this piece is to provide students and academics with a comprehensive list of definitions and categorizations of concepts related to strategic management that can be utilized to correctly frame and apply them. I have collected and summarized the definitions here, with direct quotes when necessary.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> "Concrete approach to aligning the aspirations and the capabilities of public organizations or other entities in order to achieve goals and create public value."</p>
            <p><strong>Strategist:</strong> Individuals, teams, or organizations involved in the process of strategy-making. Four types are identified based on two characteristics: aspirations and capabilities: the dreamer, the savvy strategist, the reactor and the underachiever.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategizing:</strong> "Consists of the activities undertaken by public organizations or other entities to deliberately and emergently (re)align their aspirations and capabilities, thus exploring how aspirations can actually be achieved within a given context—or else need to be changed—taking into account current capabilities and the possible need to develop new capabilities or to change the context." This definition clarifies that the authors define strategy as a practice, not as an object or a given. This implies that there is no fixed or defined process for strategizing.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategic planning:</strong> "Reasonably deliberate and deliberative approach to strategizing by public organizations or other entities that focuses on strategy formulation and typically includes (a) analyzing existing mandates, mission, values, and vision; (b) formulating updated mission, values, and vision statements; (c) analyzing the internal and external environment to identify strategic issues; and (d) formulating concrete and implementable strategies to address the identified issues."</p>
            <p>The authors also identified several existing approaches to strategic planning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Harvard Policy Model:</strong> Adapted from the private sector, this approach seeks to find the best fit between the organization and its environment by analyzing the organization's SWOT, the priorities of senior decision-makers (in this case, elected leadership), and the social obligations of the organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Logical incrementalism:</strong> Involves developing incremental changes within the organization, taking into account existing direction and realistic political limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder management:</strong> Strategic planning is considered effective only if it can satisfy the needs of stakeholders. Engagement with key parties is essential in this approach, but the authors highlight that simple participation in the planning process is not enough to ensure higher performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic negotiations:</strong> Recognizes that power is shared across many actors in the public decision-making process, requiring a long negotiation process.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic issues management:</strong> Focuses on the identification of key issues that need direct attention, even outside of the regular strategic planning process, which occurs infrequently.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic planning as a framework for innovation:</strong> Uses the planning process as a means to foster innovation within the organization, encouraging a more entrepreneurial culture.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The remaining two approaches focus on what should be the content of public sector strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Portfolio approach:</strong> suitable for larger and ramified organizations, it consists in grouping entities within the main organization based on strategically significant dimensions, to plan more efficiently and tailor strategies to the characteristics of the portfolio.</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive analysis:</strong> Considers public entities as organizations operating in a competitive environment where businesses and other enterprises are also active.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Strategic management:</strong> "Approach to strategizing by public organizations or other entities which integrates strategy formulation and implementation and typically includes strategic planning to formulate strategies, ways of implementing strategies, and continuous strategic learning."</p>
            <p>Here, strategic management is defined as a broader concept, of which strategic planning is only the starting point. The authors proceed to identify six "ideal" ways in which strategic management is institutionalized:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integrated units of management / layered / stacked:</strong> Involves creating an integrated set of strategies across different levels of the organization, aiming to plan and control all aspects related to the internal and external environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic issues management:</strong> Based on the creation of a central analysis team that monitors data to identify issues that need to be strategically addressed by the organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Contract approach:</strong> Involves creating a series of contracts that bind individual entities at lower levels to a specific set of objectives, negotiated at a central level.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration approach:</strong> Based on forming networks that share power and resources and constantly collaborate to define issues and prompt strategic actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio management:</strong> (See portfolio management in the strategic planning section)</li>
                <li><strong>Goals or benchmark approach:</strong> Developed by setting goals derived from competitors or comparable entities to support implementation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Relevance for current times:</h3>
            <p>In highly complex and uncertain times, public organizations are often forced to act reactively to crises. However, the relevance of strategic thinking is arguably greater now than ever. Using Bryson and George's frameworks can help public managers not only survive but also innovate and create public value despite constraints.</p>

        summary: "Wilson's book about bureaucracy can be considered one of the cornerstones of public administration literature, detailing what is generally true about government agencies.",
        content: `
            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>Wilson's book about bureaucracy can be considered one of the cornerstones of public administration literature, and despite its publishing year, it still contains relevant and thought-provoking insights on bureaucratic behavior that I consider universally relevant.</p>
            <p>I happened to read this volume at the same time as Reinventing Government by Osborne and Gaebler, and I was intrigued by the strong exchange between the two. While they share the same topic (public organizations and their behaviour), the tone and objective is substantially different. Wilson takes an academic approach; he describes what is generally true about government agencies and the reasons behind the behaviour of civil servants and managers. Osborne's book is a manifesto of his movement, through which he proposes a new way of organizing and managing government agencies, attempting to reform a system that has been in place for decades.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <p><strong>Chapter 2 - Organization matters:</strong> The success of public organizations depends on how well they tackle three key issues: performing their critical task, securing agreement among most actors on the definition of that task, and acquiring the freedom of action and political support needed to redefine the task if necessary.</p>
            <p>Wilson argues that tasks are often more important than goals when goals are vague and difficult to measure, as in the case of public agencies. The definition of a critical task and agreement on it can instill a sense of mission that supports the organization’s activities.</p>
            <p><strong>Chapter 4 - Beliefs:</strong> The imperatives and constraints of a given situation shape the way tasks are performed more than the specific attitudes of workers. With this thesis, Wilson attempts to show why politicians should worry less about civil servants trying to obstruct their plans, a common concern among politicians from all parties. Psychological evidence suggests that behavior is influenced less by personal opinions and more by the rewards and penalties associated with alternative courses of action.</p>
            <p><strong>Chapter 7 - Constraints:</strong> Government agencies often suffer from negative popular stereotypes. However, Wilson argues that these perceptions are not always reflected in reality. What are the main constraints public entities face compared to private sector organizations? Some key challenges include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The inability to retain and distribute earnings to members of the organization.</li>
                <li>Difficulty in allocating resources according to the preferences of the administrator.</li>
                <li>The obligation to serve goals that are not chosen by the organization itself.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These factors lead to a management style that is often \"constraints-driven\" rather than \"efficiency-driven.\" Wilson presents an interesting hypothetical scenario, describing what would happen if the Registry of Motor Vehicles were managed like a McDonald's. Suppose the manager wanted to improve service; this might require raising costs (which is difficult, as legislators have little incentive to fund a more efficient registry), replacing personnel (almost impossible for civil servants), or increasing training (which also requires funding). Even if the manager successfully increases efficiency despite these limitations, the gains do not translate into higher earnings for the agency. In fact, if service improves too much, there is a risk that citizens from other areas will flock to the Registry, increasing workload and straining resources in a way that damages other constituencies. The optimal service level, therefore, becomes one where everyone is only moderately dissatisfied.</p>
            <p><strong>Chapter 9 - Compliance:</strong> This chapter provides a brief explanation of how principal-agent models function in government settings and highlights why managers are essential, despite the many limitations they face in a public sector context. The issue of shirking is more complex in government agencies for three reasons: (1) The output is often unobservable or unknowable; (2) Agents have multiple principals whose preferences change frequently; (3) Agents operate within their own political and professional norms. After introducing these significant challenges, Wilson explains why bureaucrats still perform their jobs effectively: civil servants may have an intrinsic motivation to do their job well, and managers can foster a sense of mission through purpose, status, and solidarity.</p>
            <p>According to Wilson, the optimal managerial approach varies depending on the characteristics of the organization. He categorizes public agencies into four types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Production organizations:</strong> Observable output and outcome (e.g., Postal Service). Management resembles the private sector.</li>
                <li><strong>Procedural organizations:</strong> Observable output, unobservable outcome (e.g., juvenile reformatories). Focus is on standardized processes and professional norms.</li>
                <li><strong>Craft organizations:</strong> Unobservable output, observable outcome (e.g., armed forces at war). Essential to foster a strong sense of mission and professional autonomy.</li>
                <li><strong>Coping organizations:</strong> Unobservable output and outcome (e.g., diplomats, police). Leaders must rely on individual talent and monitoring systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Relevance for current times:</h3>
            <p>Wilson does not shy away from offering his own perspective on public management as a discipline. He (cynically) describes it as engaging with \"a world of settled institutions designed to allow imperfect people to use flawed procedures to cope with insoluble problems\" (Chapter 20). He also emphasizes the challenges of implementing scientific methods in a field where, at the time, empirical evidence was underutilized.</p>
            <p>He concludes by discussing possible ways to improve government organization. One of his key insights on government criticism is: \"Many of the difficulties we experience in dealing with government agencies arise from the agencies being part of a fragmented and open political system... The greatest mistake citizens can make when they complain about the bureaucracy is to suppose that their frustration arise simply out of management problems; they do not - they arise out of governance problems\". (Chapter 20)</p>
            <p>I find this message incredibly powerful, as it provides a well-reasoned response to the increasingly frequent and superficial criticisms of government from global political leaders. With public trust in government steadily declining, Wilson's message could be key to shifting public perception toward a more positive view of public institutions.</p>

            <h3>The 10 Principles of Reform</h3>
            <p>Through 5 years of efforts, they distilled ten core principles followed by the most virtuous American public organizations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Promote competition among service providers</li>
                <li>Empower citizens to take control</li>
                <li>Measure success by outcomes, not inputs</li>
                <li>Be guided by missions, not rigid rules</li>
                <li>Redefine citizens as customers</li>
                <li>Prevent problems before they emerge, rather than reacting</li>
                <li>Earn money, don’t just spend it</li>
                <li>Decentralize authority</li>
                <li>Prefer markets to bureaucracy</li>
                <li>Engage all sectors to solve community problems</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These constitute a new paradigm for "reforming government" but also an analytical tool, that can be used to analyze any kind of public enterprise and propose changes based on the direction proposed.</p>
            <h3>Case Studies: Reform in Action</h3>
            <p>In different chapters they describe concrete examples of change for each of the key principles, showing how best performers in the country are reforming government.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Competition in service provision (Chapter 3):</strong> Privatization of service delivery is only one possible way of increasing competition. Other forms can be to create competition between public and private providers or even between several public entities.
                <br><em>Example:</em> New York Sanitation Department (1980s). Internal repair shops for their vehicles were inefficient, so the department started publishing financial performance charts for each shop, just as if they were private businesses. The transparency drove employees to compare to the market and improve their service, saving $2.4 million annually.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Mission-driven government (Chapter 4):</strong> Governments have a tendency to create new rules and entities that soon become obsolete and constitute an obstacle for efficiency. For example, spending limits introduced in 1930s got removed only in 1980s (Minnesota Agencies) or detachments created in wartimes continue to be funded in the UK). The authors identify 3 possible ways to reduce the risk of obsolete regulations: sunset laws, review commissions and zero-based budgeting. They underline the importance of designing a "mission-driven budget system" to shift from a "spend it or lose it" paradigm to a "save and invest it" one.
                <br><em>Example:</em> Fairfield, California (1978). Instead of traditional budgeting, they implemented mission-driven budgeting: the city council determined only broad categories of spending, without line items, and each department was allowed to keep the money not spent each year. This system allowed the city to drastically reduce spending while maintaining high levels of services, and was soon adopted by a lot of other American municipalities.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Citizens as customers (Chapter 6):</strong> Most government agencies do not get funds from their own customers, differently from a business. Agencies get funds from the legislature and elected boards. That is why it is so difficult to get public bureaucracy to be customer-oriented: often they are not incentivized to make the customer happy. Public entities can apply private sector methodologies such as Total Quality management to improve their customer orientation.
                <br><em>Example:</em> Fox Valley Technical College, Wisconsin. They implemented a Total Quality approach, restructuring operations to align with student needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pollitt & Bouckaert (who analyzed public management reform in their book first published in 2000) on the other hand, take a more measured stance: "It might work, but there will be side effects." Critics of traditional bureaucracies—such as Osborne and Gaebler—often emphasize their downsides, including rigidity and centralization, while overlooking their strengths. Bureaucracies, for example, provide continuity and uphold principles of equity. When shifting to a new paradigm, it is crucial not to disregard what is left behind.</p>

            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>This post delves into one of the core concepts in the public administration literature: street-level bureaucracy. The idea of "street-level" bureaucrats, as opposed to administrators isolated from society, was introduced by M. Lipsky in 1980. He described them as civil servants who engage in direct contact with citizens. This category includes a large number of public sector workers, such as teachers, police officers, and social workers, among others.</p>
            <p>Because of the nature of their work and their continuous interaction with citizens, these professionals often develop relationships that are not only professional but also emotional and personal.</p>
            <p>These are the aspects that Maynard-Moody and Musheno explore in their seminal article on street level bureaucrats. They argue for a more nuanced understanding of the concept; one that also considers how these workers conceptualize their own roles and the importance of discretion in their everyday decisions.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <p>The authors carefully trace the dominant academic narrative of street-level bureaucrats as "State-Agents" back to Lipsky’s original definition. They then contrast this with an alternative perspective that emerged from their own field research, which they label as "Citizen-Agents." Below is a brief summary of these two contrasting views:</p>
            <h4>1. Street level bureaucrats as "State-Agents" - Scholarly view:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Discretion is inevitable due to nature of the job: they cannot be completely controlled by their principals (elected officials)</li>
                <li>They are guided by self-interest but they can also be idealists</li>
                <li>Their actions are part of policy-making and have a strong influence on policy results</li>
                <li>Discretion is a danger to be controlled, although it is challenging. But in some cases it can also be a positive source of responsiveness</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Street level bureaucrats as "Citizen-Agents" - Practitioners' view:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Their judgement of the context goes before the rules (with something that authors call “pragmatic improvisation”)</li>
                <li>Their relationship with the citizen is central for their behaviour</li>
                <li>They don’t see themselves as part of the process of policymaking</li>
                <li>The role of elected officials is marginal for them</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These conceptions seem to emerge as competing and incompatible. However, the authors strongly argue that there is not a unique truth. Actually, together they can give a more complete understanding of the functioning of the modern state. Teachers and policeman are both State- and Citizen-Agents, and despite the framing of their role, they cannot escape from the constraints of elected officials and regulations. What emerges is a desire to be recognized also as Citizen-Agents, a view that valorizes their judgement and abilities.</p>
            <h3>Methodology:</h3>
            <p>The authors employ qualitative methods within an interpretivist framework. Their focus is on the meaning that emerges from stories told by street-level bureaucrats themselves. They collected 162 first-person stories across five American public organizations, including schools, rehabilitation centers, and police stations.</p>
            <p>The strength of this method lies in the freedom it gives interviewees to express their own views and understanding of their roles. However, as the authors acknowledge, this approach risks overemphasizing dramatic or non-routine events at the expense of everyday norms.</p>
            <h3>Relevance for current times:</h3>
            <p>Street level bureaucrats lived their moment of highest popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic. Their precious job in several areas of public services delivery was recognized and praised publicly by politicians and institutions. However, as soon as the emergency period ended, everything went back to the same routine. For many healthcare and education workers, this means having to deal with increasing pressures and demands, while resources are shrinking.</p>
            <p>The narrative of Citizen-Agents highlights the need of street level bureaucrats to be recognized as more independent and valuable actors in the large state machine. It underscores the strength of their motivation and drive in performing key functions in our society. I believe that a third narrative of street level bureaucrats is possible. One that highlights their role both as part of a set of institutional rules and embedded in relationships with citizens. I like to call this "Society-Agents", and I believe this view should become dominant in the public opinion, in order to recognize more strongly their precious role.</p>

            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>"Public Management Reform" is the result of a remarkable effort to research, summarize and rationalize evidence of public management reforms in 12 countries, recognizing similarities and differences, and generating a general theory of government reform that has been a point of reference for scholars of the discipline for more than 20 years. Few papers that deal with public sector reforms do not cite the work of Pollit and Bouckaert.</p>
            <p>One of the aspects that I appreciated the most in this book is the transparency of the authors, who state clearly the limitations of generalized statements on a topic that is widely shaped by rhetoric, while at the same time trying their best to collect and compare data on several countries since the 1980s. Indeed, sometimes the reader might question if the cases described are actually an instance of the same phenomenon, but the authors are very skilled in framing and substantiating what they discuss.</p>
            <p>The main topics discussed by Pollitt and Bouckaert are: what are public management reforms; how does reform happen and why; what are the differences among the countries analyzed, both in starting point and evolution; what evidence is available on the reforms' results; what are the advantages and disadvantages of PM reform for politicians and finally what are the limits and contraddictions of PM reform.</p>
            <p>In the second edition published in 2004 they included case studies based on 12 OECD member countries. The amount of information contained in their book is colossal, therefore this article will focus primarily on the analytic theories that emerge from chapters 1 to 5, which can be useful for students and scholars of government. Chapters 6 and 8 focus on the relationship between PM reforms, politics and governance, while chapter 7 (which I found very convincingly argued) highlights some of the paradoxes that emerged during reforms.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <h4>CHAPTER 1 - THE NATURE OF PUBLIC MANAGEMENT REFORM</h4>
            <p>This chapter is dedicated to the framing and definition of the main concepts.</p>
            <p>Definition of public management reform: "PM reform consists of deliberate changes to the structures and processes of public sector organizations with the objective of getting them (in some sense) to run better" (pag. 8).  Some considerations stemming from their definition:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PM reform is "deliberate", therefore the result of a coherent set of ideas (more or less specified), that are generated from the actors that participate in the reform process (leading politicians, senior civil servants, outsiders such as academics, consultants and international organizations)</li>
                <li>Reforms happen at different levels: Structural changes include changes to the organizations themselves, while process changes can span from HR systems to the micro processes that regulate quality standards</li>
                <li>The idea of "running better" might be subjective. PM reforms are associated with multiple goals: not only substantive goals (efficiency, effectiveness, higher control) but also political ones (legitimacy, power, attention)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>CHAPTER 2 - PROBLEMS AND RESPONSES: A MODEL OF PUBLIC MANAGEMENT REFORM</h4>
            <p>The authors propose a general model of PM reform that is embodied in a conceptual map. The aim of this model is to describe all the forces at work, both internal and external, that allow to gain a general understanding of the origin and results of a reform process. At its core, the model is structured around elite decision-making (senior politicians and civil servants) which is shaped by socio-economic forces, the political system, and the existing administrative system. Reform involves designing reform packages, implementing them, and observing results, which often feed back into the decision-making process.</p>
            <h4>CHAPTER 3 - MANY HOUSES: TYPES OF POLITICO-ADMINISTRATIVE REGIME</h4>
            <p>According to the authors' institutionalist view, context is key. They identify several features that distinguish different types of regimes: State structure, nature of executive government, relationships between politicians and top bureaucrats, dominant administrative culture, and diversity of channels of influence.</p>
            <h4>CHAPTER 4 - TRAJECTORIES OF MODERNIZATION AND REFORM</h4>
            <p>This chapter explores patterns of change in public sector structures (financial management, personnel, organizational) and processes. Examples include block-budgeting, performance-related contracts, and strategic planning.</p>
            <h4>CHAPTER 5 - RESULTS: THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY</h4>
            <p>The authors distinguish four levels of results: operational (effectiveness), processual, capacity-related, and strategic. Evaluation is complex as results are often subjective and shaped by rhetoric.</p>
            <h3>Relevance for current times:</h3>
            <p>This book remains a point of reference for understanding why even similar reform ideas (like NPM) were adopted and implemented so differently across various countries, reminding us that local context and institutional history are always paramount.</p>

            <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12119" target="_blank">Original Article</a></p>
            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>Since the beginning of their academic journey, students of public policy are exposed to a variety of country-level performance indicators, from the most basic ones related to public finance (e.g.: ratings by financial institutions) to the ones created by international non-profit organizations (e.g.: <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2024" target="_blank">Corruption index</a> by Transparency International; <a href="https://www.imd.org/centers/wcc/world-competitiveness-center/rankings/world-competitiveness-ranking/" target="_blank">World Competitiveness Ranking</a> by IMD Business School).</p>
            <p>When interpreting these indicators it is essential to reflect on their meaning and origin: who published it? Why? And what is the underlying methodology? I decided to summarize this insightful paper by Kelley and Simmons to bring attention to the "soft power" dimension of international performance indicators, an element that might be decreasing in international relevance but has surely shaped international politics for the last 50 years.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <p>The authors conceptualize performance indicators as a form of social pressure in international politics. They ground their analysis in a comprehensive understanding of the way in which countries influence each other. One way is through binding tools and physical means, the other is social pressure.</p>
            <p>Indicators started to emerge as a prominent tool for international power since military coercion and direct sanctions were considered very challenging to enact. Therefore, prominent institutions with power to manage resources and information worldwide started to create monitoring systems with the potential to affect other actors' choices.</p>
            <p>Indicators can affect state behaviour through different channels. The authors created a graph that effectively explains the different ways in which indicators (and their sponsoring entities) can affect domestic policy direction.</p>
            <p>In short, the paper's main argument is: indicators can strongly influence domestic policy action, especially when they are comparative, systematic, widely disseminated and produced by a respected actor.</p>
            <p>In the body of the paper the authors examine a specific case to prove their point: the US fight against human trafficking.</p>
            <p>In 2001 the US State Department started to publish a yearly Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, which included country rankings and a 3-tier classification. Despite not being considered scientific, it was a very influential report attracting media coverage and used as source of information by several international organizations.</p>
            <p>By analysing the country rankings produced in the period 2000-2011, they found that the US successfully used rankings to push other countries to criminalize human trafficking in the law. More precisely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Countries were more likely to criminalize trafficking domestically if they were included in the report</li>
                <li>Countries being placed in the lowest rankings were most likely to criminalize</li>
                <li>Demoted countries were also most likely to criminalize in the subsequent years</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Methodology:</h3>
            <p>First they excluded the hypothesis of selection affecting the results: it is not likely that the US strategically shamed countries that were likely to criminalize anyway.</p>
            <p>Then the main analysis used a Cox proportional hazards model to assess the effect of US monitoring on country domestic policies. This model is used in survival analysis to determine the influence of different variables on the time passing before an event occurs. In this case, the event is the criminalization of human trafficking in domestic law, and presence in the US reports and classification of each country are included as main explanatory variables. Moreover they measure demotions (reduction in classification) and include US aid as a potential pressure factor. Several other relevant variables were added as controls.</p>
            <p>Despite not being a causally solid framework, the authors claim that their analysis can provide enough evidence to show that indicators have a significant impact on state action, comparing the effect of TIP report with other relevant variables.</p>
            <h3>Relevance for current times:</h3>
            <p>If on one side new techniques have made data collection more and more pervasive in our society, generating new possibilities of monitoring country performance, on the other it is becoming challenging to identify trustworthy sources of information. The World Bank Ease of Doing Business indicator was interrupted after accusations of corruption and manipulation. In the US, the responsible for labour data was recently dismissed by the president who accused her of spreading false information, and misinformation campaigns are now critical elements of national elections.</p>
            <p>The potential of soft power based on evidence and data is reducing in this evolving landscape. Moreover, the United States seem to have abandoned their role of international moral judge, while international organizations are losing global influence. Unfortunately, physical coercion and brute force seem to be regaining ground as primary tools for influence in international politics.</p>

            <h3>Introduction and context:</h3>
            <p>In their paper, Elston and Zhang contribute to the long-standing literature on the role of "bureaucrats" (or civil servants, functionaires, public employees…) in the transmission of policy from paper to practice.</p>
            <p>I believe this is a particularly interesting area of inquiry, that has a long tradition starting with Pressman and Wildawsky's very long-titled book published in 1973*.</p>
            <p>While the core mechanisms of policy implementation may not have changed substantially since the 1970s, the amount of data available to researchers has expanded dramatically, enabling more fine-grained empirical analysis and the discovery of innovative insights.</p>
            <p>The context of this paper is the United Kingdom, a country known for a strong managerial traditions within its bureaucracy. More precisely, they analyze the requests of the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee, an oversight (political) body tasked with auditing government programs across all public entities (bureaucratic).</p>
            <p>The key question they try to answer is: what matters for bureaucracies to be responsive to political requests? In this case they focus on the requests coming from the PAC to the single entities, which constitute a rich dataset of 1674 requests from 2010 to 2015, including responses from the bureacracy together with time for completion (until 2020).</p>
            <p>The real empirical innovation of their paper is to match this data with 4 different measures of organizational-level bureaucratic "slack", including both administrative and survey data.</p>
            <h3>Key insights:</h3>
            <p>When assessing what matters for bureacrats' responsiveness to democratically-elected political leaders, previous literature has focused on organizational capacity, taking too often for granted that any new request (when accepted) will be implemented in existing public organizations, and forgetting that previous commitments are rarely discontinued and resources remain more or less the same. This creates a challenge for bureaucrats, who are called to continue building up new requests with limited capacity, a phenomenon that is commonly referred to as "administrative overload" (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/35/4/422/8176758" target="_blank">see also another very well-done paper by Kaplaner et al., 2025</a>).</p>
            <p>The authors argue that for implementing policies coming from the political principals, not only organizational capacity matters, but also the availability of "slack" resources that allow to adapt to new instructions.</p>
            <p>Three main empirical results emerge from their analysis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organizations with more worker-perceived slack are more likely to agree with the political requests</li>
                <li>Organizations with budgetary slack are more likely to commit to a precise timeline to complete the political assignment</li>
                <li>Organizations with budgetary slack are more likely to fulfill their commitments to the PAC (perceived slack not significant for this outcome)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, they insist on the importance of workers-perceived slack, being the variable with the greatest explanatory power in their model. Moreover, they argue that this survey-collected variable might also a proxy for staff morale, another possible key factor for responsiveness, even if they do not empirically test for this.</p>
            <h3>Methodology:</h3>
            <p>They construct a dataset with a row for each PAC request, collecting them from official reports. To each request they assign the main responsible organization, and attach specific data pertaining to each.</p>
            <p>One of the key methodological features of this article is the choice of measuring organizational slack in a more nuanced way compared to previous studies in political science / public administration. They derive from the management literature 4 different measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Budget underspending (from official budget data, lagged by one year before dependent variable so account for time effects)</li>
                <li>Budget increase dummy</li>
                <li>% of manager over total headcount (from Civil Service Statistics)</li>
                <li>Workers-perceived slack (from two questions of the Civil Service People Survey, mean share of employees agreeing to have "an acceptable workload" and "a good work-life balance")</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In their main analysis (regression, two-way fixed effects), the authors exploit within-organization, over-time variation to estimate how changes in bureaucratic slack relate to responsiveness to PAC requests. At the request level, they regress (i) a binary indicator for whether a request is fully accepted (logit) and (ii) the precision of the implementation timeline (OLS) on 4 different time-varying measures of slack mentioned above, plus controls for the type of request (6 categories) and the presence of collaboration between entities. They include organization fixed effects to absorb all time-invariant differences across departments/agencies (e.g., culture, baseline capacity) and year fixed effects to net out common shocks or trends affecting all organizations in a given year (e.g., political or macro conditions). Identification (although not fully causal) therefore comes from year-to-year changes in slack within the same organization, compared against other organizations in the same year.</p>
            <p>The main limitation of this methodology is the absence of a credible causal identification strategy, therefore the results are subject to endogeneity concerns. For example, the PAC may adjust requests endogenously, giving more workload to entities that exhibit more slack. Nevertheless, the authors do a good job in justifying the results with an extensive battery of robustness tests.</p>
            <h3>Relevance for current times:</h3>
            <p>Contemporary bureaucracy is caught in a pincer grip. On one side, public administrations are called to perform at increasingly higher levels due to citizens' demands, who expect service delivery and customer service to be at the same level as major digital corporations.</p>
            <p>On the other side, populist political leaders are progressively undermining bureaucratic institutions by portraying civil servants as obstacles to change, blaming them for policy failures, and systematically hollowing out their material and human capacities.</p>
            <p>I believe empirical works such as Elston and Zhang's are helpful to illuminate the conditions under which public organizations can remain responsive rather than inert. More broadly, this line of research can contribute to informing public debate by clarifying that bureaucratic performance is not merely a matter of will or effort, but is deeply shaped by factors that are often overlooked or deliberately obscured in contemporary political discourse. It is essential to share this brilliant work with a broader audience, in order to counter simplistic narratives about bureaucratic inefficiency and ultimately contribute to rebuilding trust in the institutions tasked with delivering public policy.</p>
